# Insure landing page

This is a solution to the [Insure landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/insure-landing-page-uTU68JV8) built using a Next.js project

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://insure-landing-page-gamma-seven.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I used this project as a way to get more familiar with using Tailwind CSS and building a project from start to finish with Next.js. I generally start building a project desktop-first, and then optimize for mobile. After I finished a first draft, I learned that Tailwind's framework is build using a Mobile first approach, so their built in media queries are using `min-width` instead of `max-width` like I generally use. This was a good challenge to learn how to refactor and change up my code so it aligns better with the design system that I chose.

### Continued development

I struggled with getting the image in the hero section optimized on all screen-sizes, and want to clean this up further on future iterations. I'd also like to learn more about how best to integrate images and SVGs (i.e using <svg> directly, or instead importing the image from a folder)

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I really liked the documentation for Tailwind and found it easy to use and navigate. This was my first time using it, so I had to reference this a lot to get a hang of the short-hand they use for classes. Overall I enjoyed using it!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
